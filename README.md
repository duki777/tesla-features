# Tesla Feature Requests


Self driving cars are coming for sure. I personally believe it will not be magic leap. We will have a lot of small features first and then it will be combined and have a perfect self driving car.

I would love to share some of the feature requests for tesla.


I don't have Tesla so if the features exists, please help me to close the issues.

All features check
